The Oculus Quest 2 was an exciting buy, as it reminded me of the original iPhone: a form factor fit for prime time. 

I had prior experience with VR, having coded a cross-platform video streaming app called Anzac360. The Unity-based project was fun to build, and exposure to the Rift and Oculus Go was eye-opening. 

The first few hours of playing with Quest 2 was one of the most impactful moments in my gadget life. The Epic roller coasters app was first up on the list, and playing it in shooter mode with a controller in each hand was engaging. This app turned out to be among the most nauseating, but still tolerable and it felt better with each game. The next app was a fishing simulator called Bait, which gave a solid indication of the training potential of VR. It was a little frustrating to get the knack of the controls, but appealing enough to hold my attention. The third game was table tennis: it blew me away. After basic onboarding, a notification popped up for a game invite. I accepted, and within a few seconds, a human voice greeted me. I replied, realised it was a legit conversation, and then we commenced play. It was a shaky start on the serving front, but the opponent (from New Zealand) coached me through the trouble, and then we hit stride. During rallies we spoke about South Africa, Australia and VR, and had a fair game. It was remarkable to me how people from different countries could connect so quickly, have a realistic game of table tennis online, and exchange stories via head-set mic. The social power of VR struck home, and facebook's venture in Oculus seemed like a completely natural fit.
