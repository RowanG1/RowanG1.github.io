I was quite excited to get the Oculus Quest 2, as it reminded me of the original iPhone: a form factor that was good enough for the broad market. 

I had some experience with VR development before getting the Oculus Quest 2: a cross-platform video streaming app in honour of Anzac. The Unity-based project was fun to build, and exposure to the Rift and Oculus Go was eye-opening. 

The first few hours of playing with Quest 2 was one of the most impactful moments in my gadget life. The roller-coaster app was first up on the list, and playing it in shooter mode with a controller in each hand was engaging. The next app was fishing: a solid gauge of the training utility of VR. It was a little frustrating to get the knack of the controls, but enough to keep my momentum. The third game I played was Table tennis: it blew me away. After basic onboarding, a notification popped up for a game invite. I accepted, and in a few seconds, a human voice greeted me. I replied, realised it was a legit conversation, and then we commenced play. It was a shaky start on the serving front, but the opponent (from New Zealand) coached me through the trouble, and then we got into a rhythm quickly. During rallies we spoke about South Africa, Australia and VR, and had a good game. It was remarkable to me how people from different countries could meet so easily, have a realistic game of table tennis online, and exchange stories. The social power of VR struck home, and facebook's role in VR seemed like a completely natural fit.
