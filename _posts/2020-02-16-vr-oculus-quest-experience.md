The Oculus Quest 2 was an exciting buy, as it reminded me of the original iPhone: a form factor fit for prime time. What makes it compelling is that the user can move around untethered, running apps with ample processing power and decent battery life.

I had prior experience with VR, having coded a cross-platform video streaming app called Anzac360. The Unity-based project was fun to build, and exposure to the Rift and Oculus Go was eye-opening. 

The first few hours of playing with Quest 2 was one of the most impactful moments in my gadget life. The Epic roller coasters app was first up on the list, and playing it in shooter mode with a controller in each hand was engaging. This game was slightly nauseating, but still tolerable and it felt better with each game.  Next up was a fishing simulator called Bait, which gave a solid indication of the training potential of VR. It was a little frustrating to get the knack of the controls, but appealing enough to hold my attention. 

The third game was table tennis: it blew me away. After basic onboarding, a notification popped up for a game invite. I accepted, and within a few seconds, a human voice greeted me. I replied, realised it was a legit conversation, and then we commenced play. It was a shaky start on the serving front, but the opponent (from New Zealand) coached me through the trouble, and then we hit stride. During rallies we spoke about South Africa, Australia and VR, and had a fair game. The social power of VR struck home, and facebook's venture in Oculus seemed like a completely natural fit. I only realised a few days later that real-time shot-making with internet latency shows how good the internet has become.

The Quest 2 runs essentially on Android for its primary untethered mode, for which there are fewer game titles available than on the Oculus Rift series headsets, which runs connected to a PC (typically Windows). But hey presto, the Quest 2 can also connect to a PC, and run the same apps as Rift. So, best of both worlds. You need a USB 3 cable, and your smartphone charging cable probably can't do the job. Oculus supplies a special fibre optic 5m "Oculus link", which can handle high data throughput, and survive many hours of play. As you might expect, it is expensive. After some scouting on Amazon and Google for substitutes, it turned out that the Oculus link is pretty much the only option. The major marketplaces for Oculus compatible apps are Steam VR and the Oculus store. I had previously bought a racing game called Dirt 2.0 on Steam, and it so happens to also run on VR. So off to the races. The experience of racing on VR is far more immersive than on a 2D screen. It felt like I could handle the car better, due to depth perception, but I also drove more conservatively because the trees and rocks looked more lethal. The experience was a lot more nauseating than the roller coaster game, suprisingly. Navigating the rally menus via PC keyboard with head-set on was cumbersome, and the Quest 2 native games offer much better situational awareness. Performance-wise, the Quest 2 native games perform smoothly in general, and the PC-connected rally game was the most sluggish of all the titles I played (on a mid-range gaming laptop). Comparisons are difficult, but the roller-coaster game felt to me visually rich and silky.

What is clear, is that Apple's alleged upcoming move into VR is exciting. With Apple silicon, and their wonderful display pedigree, they are sure to make a dent in the virtual universe.
