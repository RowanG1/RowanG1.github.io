The Oculus Quest 2 reveal a few months ago reminded me of the original iPhone: a form factor fit for prime time. What makes it compelling is that the user can move around untethered, running apps with ample processing power and decent battery life. I got one two weeks back, and the experience is worth sharing.

I had prior exposure to VR, having re-built a cross-platform video streaming app called Anzac360. The Unity-based project was fun to create, and running on the Rift and Oculus Go was eye-opening. 

The initial hours of playing with Quest 2 was one of the most impactful moments in my gadget life. The *Epic roller coasters* app was first up on the list, and playing it in shooter mode with a controller in each hand was novel (a generation of ambidextrous children is coming). This mind-churning game is slightly nauseating, but still tolerable and the runs felt better over time.  The big concern for me at the beginning was that I might fall over in a dizzy spell, but fortunately I stayed on my (spread apart) feet. The game offers a good mix of shooting challenges in different situations, some of which are wild and impossible. A late discovery was how much fun the race mode is- the game turns into scalextric with a cock-pit view. I really enjoyed the challenge of pushing the limits, and flew off the circuit numerous times. The sound and visuals make it wonderfully realistic. All round, I admire the creativity of the game-makers who made the best of the roller-coaster idea: it is almost a theme park.

Next up was a fishing game called *Bait*, which seemed part game, part simulator. The graphics are intermediate complexity, with subtle changes in the environment during play such as flapping sea-gulls, and gently moving waters. The challenges were well-paced, and tied with relatable stories by way of interactions with virtual people. It was a little tricky to get the knack of the controls, and the initial low fish catch reminded me of harbour fishing as a child. In time the casting, hooking, and reeling in became a breeze. If I did play the game in future, the appeal would be the sense of relaxation rather than the mechanics of catching fish.  But if Uber Eats delivered fish and chips after nailing a challenge, I'd cast away!

Next up was a boxing game called *Thrill of the fight*. This is an intimdating game- the opponent is hulking, and sees every opportunity to break your defences (AI strikes again). The game is exhausting, and good for fitness or a break from sitting. For those of us who shadow box or punch bags at the gym, this game is great to experience an opponent that fights back.

At this point, I really appreciated the extra features built into Quest 2 for user orientation in the physical environment: including the front facing grayscale cameras to see the room when switching the device on, as well as a virtual clone of the hand controllers to help find the real sticks when not in hand. A guardian boundary demarcated by the user helps you to stay clear of surrounding objects.

The game that blew me away was *Eleven* table tennis. After basic onboarding, a notification popped up for a game invite. I accepted, and within a few seconds, a human voice greeted me. I replied, realised it was a legit conversation, and then we commenced play. It was a shaky start on the serving front, but the opponent (from New Zealand) coached me through the trouble, and then we hit stride. During rallies we spoke about South Africa, Australia and VR, and had a fair game. The social power of VR struck home, and facebook's venture in Oculus seemed like a completely natural fit. I only realised a few days later that real-time shot-making with internet latency shows how good the internet has become. A game with the next opponent revealed the internet's issues, and estimating the trajectory of incoming balls was a leap of faith.

I struggle with eye-strain from excessive screen-time. Playing basketball in real life gives relief and eye-training, but VR seems to help further. Apparently VR head-sets have a fixed focus distance, so maybe it differs from a laptop or smartphone and thus beneficial. It could also be that the VR objects are easier on the eyes than text; whichever, it feels good for me.

The Quest 2 runs essentially on Android for its primary untethered mode, for which there are fewer game titles available than on the Oculus Rift series headsets, which runs connected to a PC (typically on Windows). But hey presto, the Quest 2 can also connect to a PC, and run the same apps as Rift. So, best of both worlds. You need a USB 3 cable, and your smartphone charging cable probably can't do the job. Oculus supplies a special fibre optic 5m "Oculus link", which can handle high data throughput, and survive many hours of twisty play. As you might expect, it is expensive. After some scouting on Amazon and Google for substitutes, it turned out that the Oculus link is pretty much the sole supplier. The major marketplaces for Oculus apps are Steam VR and the Oculus store. I had previously bought a racing game called Dirt 2.0 on Steam, and it so happens to be VR compatible. So off to the races. The experience of racing on VR brings valued depth perception, and extended viewing such as the vehicle interior. It felt like I could handle the car better, but I also drove more conservatively because the trees and rocks looked more hazardous. The experience was a lot more nauseating than the roller coaster game, mainly noticeable after about 7 mins. Navigating the rally menus via PC keyboard with head-set on was cumbersome, and the Quest 2 optimised games offer much better situational awareness. Of course, game-pads or steering-wheel sets are better than keyboards for racing games. I look forward to experiments where the Oculus hand controllers emulate the steering wheel grip, and maybe even have throttle/brake function by way of back and forth motion. Performance-wise, the Quest 2 native games perform smoothly in general, and the PC-connected rally game was the most sluggish of all the titles I played (on a mid-range gaming laptop). Comparisons are difficult, but the roller-coaster game felt to me visually rich, varied and silky.

Watching 2D movies in VR is a lot more immersive than a flat screen. I watched a David Attenborough series called *Our Planet*, and the ocean scenes were palpable with edge-to-edge viewing and no peripheral distractions. The footage of whales was grainier on the head-set than on a 4K panel, but I was more present and captivated. Still, I watched few films on the head-set, because longer use is uncomfortable with the standard head-strap.

The lack of device-wide notifications is partly why the Oculus takes you into another dimension. There are in-app notifications, but they tend to be minimal. One senses that the VR future will bring notification over-load similar to mobile devices.

*Walkabout mini golf VR* is the most enjoyable golf game I've played on a computer. It is a superb family game, especially for members spread around the world. As a golfer, I envision using this game to improve my putting in real life, both for grooving the motion, and clutch-conditioning over putts that count.

Oculus has a distribution channel called App Lab, intended for release of experimental apps that don't require Oculus store approval. I downloaded one app called *Puzzling Places- Beta*, which is a 3-D version of a jigsaw puzzle. The challenge of matching colour patterns, as well as orientating the pieces in space was relaxing, entertaining, and a pleasant art experience. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that "share on facebook" buttons were not evident upon puzzle completion.

Artists produce some great works in VR. One interesting clip on Youtube VR is a 3-D rendition of Van Gogh's *Starry night*. The peculiar music and abstract sky lumps combined with the drifing pan through the city amplifies the original eeriness, and the swirling of the clouds is mesmerizing. Another popular clip on Youtube is *Dreams of Dali*, which plays on extremes of scale such as slender giants-  perfect for VR's depth perception. 

Travel videos are a wonderful application of VR. One of the places in NYC I did not manage to visit, was the Rockefeller centre. A short video of NYC on Oculus TV brought it to my living room, in the right season of Winter when the outdoor ice-rink is running. Central Park and the Met were two of the favorite spots while there in person, and the VR scenes brought back fond memories. Another near miss on my travels was the colloseum in Rome.  A VR clip of Rome placed me inside the Colloseum with commanding, clear views on a Sunny day.

*Superhot VR* is a popular shooter game, with an unusual feature: time only proceeds if the player moves. If you stop moving, the game freezes. The player is placed in situations where there is at least one opponent, and the goal is to make the first hit- whether by fist, bullet, or throwing some nearby object. It proceeds in episodes, where each episode is made up of a sequence of scenes, and all scenes needs to be conquered in one go to proceed to the next episode. Often, one fails near the end of the scene, and then you need to restart the episode. Maybe more experienced shooter players would advance through the levels more easily than I did. The game felt hard. Maybe I did not take advantage of being able to freeze the game. What I enjoyed about this simply designed game is that the focus is on game-play, in a world of polished graphics. The game could be more intense by using expressive body and facial gestures. Still, I bumped into furniture, and footage of my game-play would show a possessed man.

Although some of the apps were inelegant in terms of menu control design, the core experience was nailed in almost every case. It might be a direct result of physics engines, the nature of the activity, and attention paid to appealing 3-D scenery.

The cost of the games and head-set is unbelievable for what you get. The games are so compelling that an annual subscription to certain games might be a successful business model. With PC and mobile games, I cannot ever recall a time where I bought additional content for a game; this changed with the Oculus, when I unlocked additional tracks for the roller-coaster app.

What I really appreciated about the Oculus store, is the quality of reviews: it seems to be a community of constructive people, who provide useful feedback to developers and fellow users. A common request is multi-player support.

The Oculus mobile app, which is initially used to set up the device via your smartphone, is outstanding at helping users to disover content. The lessons learned from the facebook newsfeed, combined with streaming apps like Netflix, have been applied to this app superbly. The presentation feels dynamic, contextual and interesting. You find yourself previewing an app in an unusual category like "most loved", then later watching a Youtube video review of it in app, then reading a blog about a music concert in VR. The app is not flawless- like having a search bar that overlaps the status bar which makes it hard to activate, but it is well-designed overall.

One thing I did not expect is that once the user has logged in to a head-set, there is no default security pin to use the device after a period of inactivity. This look set to change with upcoming multi-user support.

We have all witnessed the ubiqituous adoption of mobile apps in virtually all spheres. Will VR turn out the same? The question is easier to answer in sectors such as fashion retailing, but harder in others: like banking, classifieds, or news feeds. I looked up applications of VR in banking, and found [^1] that a bank in Italy called Widiba had rolled out a virtual retail bank, where customers can move about, interact with agents and do transactions. If banking can benefit from VR, it would seem that every industry could gain an edge in some way. 

VR is surely set to bring giant waves of progress in human computer interaction. I generally get bored of computer games quickly, unlike real life-sports which can get me hooked. VR games keep me coming back for more, as it involves the senses and the body, and feels credibile.

With the upcoming Oculus Quest 3, as well as Apple's alleged move into VR with a premium 8K head-set, and a rich VR eco-system emerging, the near future of VR is exciting.
